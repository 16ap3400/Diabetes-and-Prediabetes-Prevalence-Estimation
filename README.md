# Diabetes-and-Prediabetes-Prevalence-Estimation
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), performed a study titled “Diabetes and Prediabetes Among Adults in Los Angeles County and the United States, 1996-2004 and 2007-2014,” which examined the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, prediabetes, and total diabetes in hopes of discovering an increase in persons over the age of twenty from the years 1999-2006 to 2007-2014. Their findings were published on April 19, 2019. Data for this study is from in-home interviews and laboratory testing conducted as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This study was performed in Los Angeles County with constructed sampling weights so that estimates accurately represent the county. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were created for diagnosed, undiagnosed, total diabetes, and prediabetes. These were then compared with sample data collected from the entire U.S.. The results of this survey show that Los Angeles County is a good estimator for the U.S. as a whole. It is also found that total diabetes increased by a statistically significant amount between 1999-2006 and 2007-2014. The difference between age groups is also proven to be statistically significant. Monitoring these trends in diabetes of adults in Los Angeles County may provide guidance for future actions taken towards diabetes prevention and control.
